          I am a Gymnastics Coach from Cordoba, Argentina. Currently, learning
          new skills so I can increase my income and work in a challenging and
          interesting field like IT.

          I am a fast learner and determined to get a job and develop my career
          as a python developer. I built this responsive website myself using some
           templates but my capabilities and interests are far more extensive than
          just web development.

          I am willing to work remote or on-site. I am ready and keen to learn
           new things and apply my knowledge and skill in a productive environment
          where I am sure I will find an exciting challenge to prove I'm really worth it.
